一：Header:
	contains:
	type of the token
	hasing algorithm
	
二：Payload:
	contains:
		claims (statements about an entity, typically the user, three types of the claims: registered, public, private)
		//registered claims:(predefined, not mandatory but recommended)
			iss, exp, sub, aud and others  (Notice that the claim names are only three characters long as JWT is meant to be compact)
			
		public claims:(can be defined by using jwts, but to avoid collisions they should be defined in IANA JSON Web Token Registry)
		
		private claims:(created to share information between parties that agree on using them)
		
		claims is Base64Url encoded, so can be readable by anyone, so do not put secret information in the payload or header unless it is encrypted//
		
三：Signature: (used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and in case of signed with a private key, can also tell who is the sender)
	contains:
		algorithm in header
		encoded header
		encoded payload
		secret (256-bit) stated from jwt official website
		
		For example: if you want to use HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:
		HMACSHA256(
		  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
		  base64UrlEncode(payload),
		  secret)
