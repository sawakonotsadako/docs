This documentation is based on Hexo official website https://hexo.io/docs/ & https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md.

Part 1: Set up hexo in your local
1. Git & Node Js installtion.

2. Run 'npm install -g hexo-cli'.

3. Check Hexo status
   a. hexo version

4. Cd to your workspace & run hexo init <your_folder_name> ('hexo init' will pull some files from GitHub and place them under <your_folder_name>)

5. Run 'hexo server' to see your first Hello World page.

Part 2: Change a theme (NexT)
1. Cd to your hexo root directory, there must be node_modules, source, themes and other directories.
   a. cd <hexo_root_directory>
   b. ls

2. Create a folder to store your theme
   a. mkdir themes/next

3. Download the latest release version (At most cases stable, recommended for beginners)
   a. curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/theme-next/hexo-theme-next/releases/latest | grep tarball_url | cut -d '"' -f 4 | wget -i - -O- | tar -zx -C themes/next --strip-components=1

   Notes: This variant will give to you only latest release version (without .git directory inside). So, there is impossible to update this version with git later. Instead you always can use separate configuration (e.g. data-files) and download new version inside old directory (or create new directory and redefine theme in Hexo config), without losing your old configuration.

4. Download the tagged release version (In rare cases useful, but not recommended)
   a. curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/theme-next/hexo-theme-next/tarball/v6.0.0 | tar -zxv -C themes/next --strip-components=1
   b. git clone --branch v6.0.0 https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next themes/next

   Notes: Replace v6.0.0 with any version from tags list (https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next/tags)

5. Download the lastest master branch (May be unstable, but include the latest features. Recommended for advanced users and for developers)
   a. curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/theme-next/hexo-theme-next/tarball | tar -zxv -C themes/next --strip-components=1
   b. git clone https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next themes/next

   Notes: This variant will give to you the whole repository (with .git directory inside). And in any time you can update current version with git and switch to any tagged release or on latest master or any other branch. At most cases useful as for users and for developers.

   Get tag list:
   a. cd themes/next
   c. git tag -l

   For example, you want to switch on v6.0.1 tagged release version. Input the following command:
   a. git checkout tags/v6.0.1

   And if you want to switch back on master branch, input this command:
   a. git checkout master

 6. Set theme in _config.yml file.
    theme: next
